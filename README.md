•	News-CategoryClassification - Text classification using Naive Bayes classifier
•	First load the json file
•	See the unique categories
•	Give the category id for each category
•	Draw the pie chart to show count of articles in each category
•	We can plot bar graph to visualize the categories and number of headlines belonging to respective category
•	We need to drop the columns which are not needed so that its easy to train.
•	We can see the data, before and after cleaning.
•	Data cleaning: This means to remove punctuations and covert to lower case
•	We need to now filter the data
•	Now we need to split the data into 80% Train, 20% Dev Data, 20% Test data
•	We can also see the count of each headline in each category
•	We need to separate features and targets
•	Caculate the prior probabilities for two categories Crime and Entertainment
•	We need to build vocabulary list
•	We can use this vocabulary and create a dictionary
We need to now find frequency/probability of each word - This is advantage of Naive Bayes
Find conditional probability
Find Top words of category = crime
Find Top words of category = entertainment
Since we got conditional probability, we will now find the prediction
